# Pokedex Project

This project is a simple web application that utilizes the Pokemon API to create a Pokedex. The Pokedex displays information about the first 150 Pokemon, including their names, IDs, types, base experience, and weight. The data is fetched from the [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/) and displayed in a clean and user-friendly interface.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## How It Works

The application makes use of the Pokemon API to fetch information about the first 150 Pokemon species. It then dynamically creates cards for each Pokemon, displaying details such as ID, name, type, base experience, and weight. The information is presented in a grid layout for easy navigation and readability.
